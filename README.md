# Datamol: Molecular Manipulation Made Easy <!-- omit in toc -->

This repo serves as the source code of the Datamol official website.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)+[Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) website bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deployment on Vercel

We use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) for our deployments.

## Contributing

1. Start a new feature branch from the `main` git branch. Give it a meaningful name.
2. Write code.
3. Format your code with `npm run format`.
4. Test the UI manually at http://localhost:3000/.
5. Make a pull request pointing back to the `main` branch when your feature is ready.
6. Once your PR is approved by at least one another teammate, merge.
